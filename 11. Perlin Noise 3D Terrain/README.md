# 3D Terrain Generation with Perlin Noise

In this coding challenge, we create a 3D procedural terrain using Perlin Noise and the beginShape() function in Processing Python.

### Important Functions

- [` beginShape()`](https://processing.org/reference/beginShape_.html): Here, used to create the mesh in the form of triangular strips.
- [`noise()`](https://processing.org/reference/noise_.html): The backbone of this code. Seriously, read up about this amazing thing.

This is the eleventh challenge in [The Coding Train's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) [Coding Challenges](https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/).
